\def \vf {$V_{1}(x,c)$}
\def \vs {$V_{2}(x,c)$}

    We assumes a Non-DTM \mf{} decides the language \lf, and 
    a Non-DTM \mf{} decides the language \ls. \\
    Let \vf{} be the verifier for \mf{} and \vs{} be the verifier
    for \ms{}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf union} \\
    We will construct a poly-time \v{} for the language, the union of 
    \lf{} and \ls{} to solve this problem.\\
    for any input $x$, given a stratage input string $c$, let \v{} = 1 iff \vf{} = 1 and \vs{} = 1. \\
    It is easy to see \v{} is the verifier which runs in polynomial time 
    given input $x$ and $c$ and \v{} is the verifier for the language, the
    union of \lf{} and \ls{}. So NP is closes under union operation. 
\item {\bf concatenation} \\
    We will construct a poly-time \v{} for the language, the union of 
    \lf{} and \ls{} to solve this problem.\\
    for any input $x$, the stratage input $c$ which is the union-encoding of the stratage $c_{1}$ for \vf{}, the stratage $c_{2}$ for \vs{}. \\
    \v{} works as the follows, creates $n + 1$ pairs, $(i, n - i), 0 \leq{} i \leq n$. Decode $c$ into $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ \\
    foreach pair $(i, n - i)$: \\
    \itab{} \tab{if {$V_{1}(x[0:i],c_{1})$} == 1 and {$V_{2}(x[i:n],c_{2})$} == 1:}\\
    \itab{} \tab{} \tab{\v{} = 1, accepts} \\
    end
    \v{} = 0, rejects. (Because no pairs work given the stratage $c_{1}$ 
    and $c_{2}$. \\
    It is easy to see \v{} is the verifier which runs in polynomial time 
    given input $x$ and $c$ and \v{} is the verifier for the language, concatenation of \lf{} and \ls{}. So NP is closes under concatenation operation. 
\item {\bf star} \\
    We will construct a poly-time \v{} for the language, the union of 
    \lf{} and \ls{} to solve this problem.\\
    Given an input $x$, we let $c$ to encode a segmentation of input $x$ into 
    $x_{1},x_{2},...x_{k}$, and a stratage of \vf{} to these $k$ segmentation $c_{1},c_{2},...c_{k}$. \\
    Then, \v{} works as follows: \\
    decode $c$ first, if $c$ can not be decoded, rejects it. \\
    for $i = 0$ to $k$: \\
    \itab{} \tab{if $V_{1}(x_{i},c_{i})$ == 1:} \\
    \itab{} \tab{} \tab{\v{} = 1, accepts} \\
    end \\
    \v{} = 0, rejects.\\
    It is easy to see \v{} is the verifier which runs in polynomial time 
    given input $x$ and $c$ and \v{} is the verifier for the language, star of \lf{}. So NP is closes under star operation. 
\end{enumerate} 
Then to prove $G$ and $H$ isomorphic. Given an input $x$ with length $n$, we encode a permutation of $n$ which is a node mapping from $G$ and $H$, 
we give a verifier \v{} given the input $x$ and encoding mapping $c$, it is easy to judge if two maps are isomorphic under this mapping in poly-time 
(just check if each mapping edge exists or doesn't exist in two graphs).
